TLS Extended Master Secret Extension Checker
============================================

This script is designed for detection of servers without support for the RFC7627 and therefore potentially vulnerable to the TLS Triple Handshake Attack (CVE-2015-6112). It attempts to negotiate using each relevant protocol version  (TLSv1, TLSv1.1, and TLSv1.2) advertising a comprehensive set of ciphers and the TLS Extended Master Secret Extension.  Servers not responding with support for this extension are considered potentially vulnerable.
